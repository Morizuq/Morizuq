## Android Native Engineer | Mobile SDK | Payment Infrastructure

I build mobile systems where trust, money, and state collide.

Currently focused on secure mobile payments, wallet infrastructure, and SDK design.


## Engineering Philosophy

I care about how things behave under stress.

• Where assumptions leak  
• Where state corrupts  
• Where attackers look first  

If it handles money, it must be boringly correct.


## What I Build

• Android-first fintech platforms  
• Payment SDKs  
• Custodial wallet systems  
• Secure authentication flows  
• Web3-integrated mobile clients  


## Currently Exploring

• Cryptographic primitives from first principles  
• Key management on mobile  
• Kotlin coroutine internals 


## Closing

If it touches money or identity, I want to understand it deeply — including how it fails.
